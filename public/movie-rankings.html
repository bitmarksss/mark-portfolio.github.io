<h1> Mark Alfred's Best Movies Recommendation</h1>
<h2> Top favorite movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Hachiko</h3>
<p> The story about a loyal dog who was found by his owner when he was a little puppy</p>

<h3>Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse</h3>
<p> I love Spiderman so I am biased in this, lmao. The story of Miles Morales as he is made to choose between his father's life versus the fate of every parallel universe.</p>

<h3>Iron Man</h3>
<p> Although the MCU's story right now is not the best, Iron Man was the reason why the MCU came to be.</p>
